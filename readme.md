# Random trees

## What is it?
Mainly a vanilla JavaScript excercise. There isn't much going on in the index.html file at the beginning. With some JS, there will be 4 random post about trees generated when the page loads. If you refresh the page you get different ones. At the end of the page, there is an "add more" button, if you click on it, there will be more content added.

I made a small dataset of 11 posts, so you can go only so far, clicking that button. The main source of the data is [this page](https://www.earthorganization.org/europe/).  

This time, I experienced a bit with SASS, and used CSS variables to make a dark mode too.

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS, SASS
* JavaScript
## But... Why?
I started learning web development a while ago, followed a bunch of tutorials, but never felt confident enough with my skills. Now I enrolled for the free month of Udacity's [Front End nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011), to check it out. 

To practice, I made the site from scratch with plain HTML and CSS. The more interesting part is the JS for sure.

## Conclusion

Ehh... How should I say... It was definitely an amazing experience, a lot of fun, but it is getting clearer and clearer why are JS Front-end frameworks so popular, so to speak :)
